# JoJos-Adventure
This is my grade 12 end-of-the-semester project using the PyCharm IDE with PyGame.
It demonstrates my knowledge of many techniques I learned throughout the semester, including Object Oriented Programming.
This project was made by Michael Bassani and Joseph Distefano from November 2017 to January 2018. 
Most assets used were not created by us. Only some were created from scratch.
